I was not able to get the keychain working. I was using a KeychainWrapper from (https://github.com/macostea/KeychainItemWrapper.swift) to store the images.

If I had more time...
1.) I would have finished the image storing
2.) Added more error handling for the camera
3.) Added the sets of images taken on the first page to be viewed whenever
4.) Shown the images as they were taken
5.) Shown all images after all 10 were taken
